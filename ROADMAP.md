# OpCentrix V3 — Unified Implementation Roadmap

> **Created**: 2026-03-17
> **Status**: IN PROGRESS — Phase 1 Hardening
> **Purpose**: Single source of truth for all implementation work. Supersedes
> `SPRINT_PLAN.md`, `OPCENTRIX_ARCHITECTURE_DECISIONS.md` phase tracker, and
> `docs/STAGED-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md`.

---

## How This Roadmap Works

1. **AI agents**: Read this file first every session. Find the current phase,
   find the first unchecked `[ ]` task — that's where to resume.
2. After completing a task, mark it `[x]`.
3. After completing a full stage, update the status badge in the Stage Map.
4. Module-specific implementation details remain in `docs/phase-N/MODULE-XX-*.md`.
   This file is the **master sequencer** — those files are the **detailed blueprints**.
5. `docs/MASTER_CONTEXT.md` has the architecture patterns, model registry, service
   registry, and route registry. Keep it updated as you build.

---

## Current State (as of 2026-03-17)

### What Exists
- Multi-tenant architecture (platform + tenant DBs) — **working**
- Authentication & authorization — **working**
- 54 entity models, 45+ services, 65+ Razor pages — **built**
- SignalR real-time machine state — **working**
- PWA support — **working**
- Data seeding (demo tenant + admin) — **working**

### The Problem
Many pages marked "complete" are **functional scaffolding**, not production-ready:
- Missing form validation (required fields, format checks, numeric ranges)
- Missing confirmation dialogs on destructive actions (delete, status changes)
- Some pages use direct `DbContext` instead of service layer
- Missing empty state handling ("No items yet" messages)
- Inconsistent error handling (some try-catch, some not)
- Some features use spoof/mock data instead of real service calls
- Authorization checks inconsistent (some pages check roles, others don't)
- DLMS/customization cross-cutting patterns not wired into existing pages

### Undocumented Features (SLS-Specific)
These were built but not in the original staged plan. They are now officially
part of the product:
- **Build Planning**: `BuildJob`, `BuildPackage`, `BuildFileInfo`, `BuildJobPart`
  models + `IBuildPlanningService` + `/builds` page
- **Part Instance Tracking**: `PartInstance`, `PartInstanceStageLog` models +
  `IPartTrackerService` + `/tracking` page
- **Maintenance Module**: `MachineComponent`, `MaintenanceRule`,
  `MaintenanceWorkOrder`, `MaintenanceActionLog` models +
  `IMaintenanceService` + `/maintenance` pages

## PHASE 1A: HARDENING

> **Goal**: Every page that currently exists becomes truly production-ready.
> No new features — only fixing, validating, and connecting what's already built.

## Architecture Principles (Quick Reference)

These apply to ALL work. See `docs/MASTER_CONTEXT.md` for full details.

1. **Multi-tenant**: Services inject `TenantDbContext` via DI. Never use direct DbContext in pages.
2. **Service layer**: Every entity has `IXxxService` + `XxxService`. Register as `Scoped`.
3. **Feature flags**: Gate optional modules with `ITenantFeatureService.IsEnabled(key)`.
4. **Custom fields**: Every major entity has `CustomFieldValues` JSON column. Use `<CustomFieldsEditor>`.
5. **Number sequences**: Use `INumberSequenceService.NextAsync("EntityType")` for auto-numbering.
6. **Workflows**: Use `IWorkflowEngine` for approval chains.
7. **Document templates**: Use `IDocumentTemplateService` for printable outputs.
8. **DLMS fields**: Add defense-specific columns but only show when `dlms` feature enabled.
9. **Shared components**: Use `AppModal`, `ConfirmDialog`, `Pagination`, `ToastService` everywhere.
10. **CSS variables**: Use `--accent`, `--bg-card`, etc. Never hardcode colors.
11. **Migrations**: `dotnet ef migrations add AddXxx --context TenantDbContext --output-dir Data/Migrations/Tenant`
